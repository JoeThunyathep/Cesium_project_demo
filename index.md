## For your demo's page, please describe your project:
The “i_city E-Bike sharing” application is a 3D web-based visual analytics application designed for researchers who interested in the relation among the different parameters from sensor systems equipped on the E-bike sharing system in Stuttgart city.

A main feature is to show a simulation of a historical E-bike route track together with a comparison chart among the different selected parameters such as battery level, geospatial altitude, pedal force, motor support level, etc. 

Users can also activate the interested layers of 3D city model in the downtown area of the Stuttgart city and some points of interest such as bike station, bus station, etc. to understand the area better. 

This application is part of my master thesis work in a topic of "Visualization and Analysis of E-bike Usage in 3D City Model by Integration of Heterogeneous Sensor Data" [Link](https://www.coors-online.de/en/lehre/abschlussarbeiten/master-arbeit-joe-thunyathep-santhanavanich/)

* Use a few sentences or a full paragraph to explain what Cesium features you are using.  

* Include your company name and/or your name.  

* Include links to your app, website, etc. 

* If the app previously used Google Earth, NASA World Wind, Skyline, or another virtual globe engine, please mention it and your experience migrating to Cesium.  

* Use only plain text or Markdown syntax so we can style and integrate it with our Jekyll-based website.  

## For your demo's page, please also provide images of your project:

Provide 3-5 full-resolution screenshots with a 4x3 aspect ratio, e.g., 800x600 (one can be the same as the representative screenshot for the main page, but at full resolution).  Put the image files in the same directory as this file.

If you have a video to include, please provide a link to it, as we can embed but not host videos.
