## For your demo's page, please describe your project:

The “i_city ebike sharing” application is a 3D web-based visual analytics application with a main feature to show a simulation of an E-bike route together with a comparison chart among the different selected parameters such as battery level, geospatial altitude, pedal force, motor support level, etc. Users can also activate the interested layers of 3D city model in the downtown area of the Stuttgart city and points of interest such as bike station, bus station, etc. In this version, the application is designed as a tool for researchers who interested in the relation among the different parameters from heterogeneous sensor systems together with the realistic environment simulation as a terrain height or a 3D city environment. 

Replace this paragraph with 2-6 paragraphs describing your app. Tell a compelling story.   
Assume the reader is not familiar with your app or the market it serves; provide context in your introduction paragraph. Most of our readers are interested in technical content, so explain your project in clear terms, without empty marketing phrases. As the developers of our open-source library, we cannot publish judgments of projects, so avoid comparisons such as "best," "fastest," etc.

* Use a few sentences or a full paragraph to explain what Cesium features you are using.  

* Include your company name and/or your name.  

* Include links to your app, website, etc. 

* If the app previously used Google Earth, NASA World Wind, Skyline, or another virtual globe engine, please mention it and your experience migrating to Cesium.  

* Use only plain text or Markdown syntax so we can style and integrate it with our Jekyll-based website.  

## For your demo's page, please also provide images of your project:

Provide 3-5 full-resolution screenshots with a 4x3 aspect ratio, e.g., 800x600 (one can be the same as the representative screenshot for the main page, but at full resolution).  Put the image files in the same directory as this file.

If you have a video to include, please provide a link to it, as we can embed but not host videos.
